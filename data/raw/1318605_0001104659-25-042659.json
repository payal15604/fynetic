The following discussion and analysis relates to the compensation arrangements for 2024 of (i) our principal executive officer, (ii) our principal financial officer, (iii) the most highly compensated person, other than our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, who was serving as executive officer at the end of our fiscal year ended December 31, 2024 and (iv) our former Senior Vice President, Powertrain and Energy Engineering, who served in such capacity during part of 2024 (our \u201cnamed executive officers\u201d). We had no other executive officers serving at the end of our fiscal year ended December 31, 2024. Our named executive officers for fiscal year 2024 were: Name Position Elon Musk Technoking of Tesla and Chief Executive Officer Vaibhav Taneja Chief Financial Officer Tom Zhu Senior Vice President, APAC Andrew Baglino Former Senior Vice President, Powertrain and Energy Engineering Mr. Baglino departed Tesla in April 2024. Overview and Fiscal Year 2024 Company Highlights Our current executive compensation program, which was developed and approved by the Compensation Committee, generally consists of base salary and equity-based incentives, as well as other benefits generally available to employees. We combine these elements in order to formulate compensation packages with the goal of providing, on a total basis, competitive pay and aligning the interests of our named executive officers with long-term shareholder interests by tying the value of their compensation to our long-term stock price and/or the achievement of financial, operational and strategic objectives. In 2024, Tesla\u2019s full-year accomplishments under our executive leadership included the following: \u00b7 Model Y was the best-selling vehicle, of any kind, globally for the full year 2024; \u00b7 Reached lowest average cost of goods per vehicle ever at less than $35,000; \u00b7 31.4 gigawatt hours of energy storage, representing an increase of 113.3%, compared to the prior year, and the completion of construction of Megafactory Shanghai; and 5 \u00b7 Further improvements and deployment of our FSD (Supervised) capabilities, including through increased AI training compute by over 400% in 2024 and the introduction of our purpose-built Robotaxi product, Cybercab. Compensation Philosophy Our mission is to accelerate the world\u2019s transition to sustainable energy. This is a long-term mission, and our compensation programs reflect this \u2014 and our startup origins \u2014 in that they consist primarily of salary or wages and equity awards. Whereas salary or wages are intended to meet our employees\u2019 near-term liquidity needs, we believe that equity awards are an effective tool for retaining employees long-term, as they vest incrementally over a period of time or upon the achievement of specified performance milestones intended to be achieved over the medium- and long-term. During periods in which our stock price and the underlying value of equity awards increase, their retention impact is even greater. We believe that the potential for such increases also creates an ownership culture that promotes holding equity, which in turn aligns the interests of our employees with the long-term interests of our shareholders. Additionally, this compensation philosophy further allows our employees to grow their skill sets and contributions consistent with our long-term mission. For these reasons, our goal is to provide each employee with the opportunity to participate in our equity programs, with certain cash-based bonus programs serving generally to accommodate specific incentive structures or liquidity needs. In light of these considerations, we generally do not make annual grants of equity awards to our senior executives, including our named executive officers , and instead grant equity awards from time to time based upon individual roles and contributions and the retentive impact of currently outstanding equity awards. By combining salary or wages and our equity award program, we strive to offer a total level of compensation that is competitive within specific roles and geographical markets. In particular, we believe that compensation for the individuals who are responsible for Tesla\u2019s strategic direction and operations should motivate them to achieve sustainable shareholder value and/or tangible milestones rather than to simply remain at Tesla or maintain the status quo. Therefore, while we offer to our general employee population restricted stock units that will retain some value even if the market value of our stock decreases, when grants are made to executive officers those grants generally comprise stock option awards, which have zero initial value and accumulate value, if at all, only to the extent that our stock price increases following their grant, through the applicable vesting dates and until such stock options are ultimately exercised and the underlying shares are sold. In addition, because equity awards comprise a greater proportion of our executive officers\u2019 total level of compensation compared to comparable roles at peer companies, a sustained decrease in our stock price or failure to achieve the applicable operational milestones may result in a level of total compensation that is significantly less than that of such peer roles. Likewise, our outside director compensation program has been comprised primarily of equity awards that are entirely in the form of stock option awards, as well as relatively modest cash retainer payments that may be waived at the election of each director. Each director determined to forego all cash retainer payments in 2024. We evaluate our compensation philosophy and programs regularly and evolve them as circumstances merit with oversight by the Compensation Committee, particularly with respect to executive and director compensation. For example, if our stock price experiences significant movement over a short period of time that results in a persistent change to equity compensation, certain adjustments may be considered to align our compensation programs to their intended purposes. In 2024, we reviewed"

For example, if our stock price experiences significant movement over a short period of time that results in a persistent change to equity compensation, certain adjustments may be considered to align our compensation programs to their intended purposes. In 2024, we reviewed our compensation programs with respect to our senior executives to align our compensation programs to their intended purposes, including striving to offer a total level of compensation that reflects individual performance to be competitive within specific roles and geographical markets and to provide appropriate retentive impact in light of currently outstanding equity awards. Following this review, in October 2024, the Compensation Committee, in consultation with its compensation consultant and our Chief Executive Officer, adjusted base salaries and/or granted equity awards to certain senior executives, which included Mr. Taneja, one of our named executive officers, whose compensation had not been adjusted since he was promoted to the role of Chief Financial Officer in August 2023, as described below. Additionally, the Company\u2019s Board of Directors has established a Special Committee to consider certain compensation matters involving Mr. Musk. Key Factors in Determining Executive Compensation Role of Compensation Committee in Executive Compensation The Compensation Committee has overall responsibility for recommending to the Board the compensation of our Chief Executive Officer and reviewing and determining the compensation of our other executive officers. Members of the Compensation Committee are appointed by the Board. Currently, the Compensation Committee consists of three members of the Board: Ira Ehrenpreis (Chair), Robyn Denholm and Kathleen Wilson-Thompson, none of whom is an executive officer of Tesla, and each of whom qualifies as an \u201cindependent director\u201d under the Nasdaq Stock Market Rules and is deemed independent under all applicable requirements of the Securities and Exchange Commission and Tesla\u2019s Corporate Governance Guidelines, which follow the Nasdaq framework for the determination of independence. 6 Role of Compensation Consultants The Compensation Committee has the authority to engage, and has from time to time engaged, the services of outside consultants to assist in making decisions regarding the establishment of Tesla\u2019s compensation philosophy and programs, including for executives and directors. In 2024, Compensia, Inc., a national consulting firm (\u201cCompensia\u201d) was retained as a compensation consultant to advise the Compensation Committee with respect to Tesla\u2019s executive compensation program. Role of Executive Officers in Compensation Decisions Historically, for executive officers other than our Chief Executive Officer, the Compensation Committee has sought and considered input from our Chief Executive Officer regarding such executive officers\u2019 responsibilities, performance and compensation. Specifically, our Chief Executive Officer recommends base salary increases and equity award levels for our senior personnel, and advises the Compensation Committee regarding the compensation program\u2019s ability to attract, retain and motivate executive talent. These recommendations reflect compensation levels that our Chief Executive Officer believes are qualitatively commensurate with an executive officer\u2019s individual qualifications, experience, responsibility level, functional role, knowledge, skills and individual performance, as well as Tesla\u2019s performance. The Compensation Committee considers our Chief Executive Officer\u2019s recommendations, but ultimately determines compensation in its judgment and approves the compensation for all of our executive officers (other than for our Chief Executive Officer, the compensation for whom is recommended by the Compensation Committee to, and ultimately approved by, the Board). The Compensation Committee meets regularly in executive session. Our Chief Executive Officer is not present during Compensation Committee deliberations or votes on his compensation and also recuses himself from sessions of the Board where the Board acts on the Compensation Committee\u2019s recommendations regarding his compensation. In addition, the Board has established a management committee under the Tesla, Inc. 2019 Equity Incentive Plan (the \u201cEquity Award Committee\u201d) to grant and administer equity awards, subject to certain limitations, such as, among other things, maximum limits on the seniority of personnel to whom the Equity Award Committee may grant awards and the value of any individual award. For example, the Equity Award Committee is not authorized to grant awards to employees at or above the level of vice president. Moreover, pursuant to applicable law, the Equity Award Committee may not grant awards to its members, and the number of shares of our common stock underlying awards granted by it may not exceed amounts determined by the Board from time to time. The Board has delegated to the Compensation Committee oversight authority over the Equity Award Committee. Role of Shareholder Say-on-Pay Votes At our 2024 annual meeting, our shareholders overwhelmingly approved the compensation of our named executive officers, with approximately 79% of our shareholders present and entitled to vote at the meeting voting in favor of our compensation policies for our named executive officers. Given these results, the Compensation Committee has decided to retain our overall approach to executive compensation while continuing to evaluate our practices. At the 2023 annual meeting of shareholders, our shareholders indicated a preference for an annual shareholder advisory vote on the compensation of our named executive officers. Consistent with the results of the shareholder vote, we intend to hold a shareholder advisory vote on executive compensation every year until the next vote on the frequency of shareholder advisory votes on executive"

We are required to hold a \u201csay on frequency\u201d vote at least every six years regarding how often to hold a shareholder advisory vote on the compensation of our named executive officers. Clawback Policy We maintain a clawback policy for compliance with the Nasdaq listing standards and Section 10D of the Exchange Act. This clawback policy applies to current and former executive officers in the event that the Company is required to prepare an accounting restatement due to the material noncompliance of the Company with any financial reporting requirement under securities laws; misconduct on the part of the executive is not required. Under this clawback policy, we are required to recoup incentive-based compensation (as that term is defined in Section 10D of the Exchange Act) erroneously received within the three completed fiscal years immediately preceding the date on which we are required to prepare an accounting restatement. 7 Our Corporate Governance Guidelines also sets forth a compensation recovery (\u201cclawback\u201d) policy with respect to our executive officers. Moreover, the terms of the performance-based stock option award granted to Elon Musk in January 2018 (the \u201c2018 CEO Performance Award\u201d) include a clawback provision in the event of a restatement of our financial statements previously filed with the SEC.

Current Elements of Named Executive Officer Compensation Base Salary The Compensation Committee is responsible for reviewing our Chief Executive Officer\u2019s and other executive officers\u2019 base salaries. The base salaries of all executive officers are reviewed and adjusted when necessary to reflect individual roles, performance and the competitive market. Because we currently do not provide cash bonuses to our executive officers, salary is the primary cash-based element of our executive officers\u2019 compensation structure. In connection with the 2024 review of our compensation programs discussed in \u201c Compensation Philosophy \u201d above, the Compensation Committee increased Mr. Taneja\u2019s base salary to reflect his promotion in August 2023 to the role of Chief Financial Officer. Mr. Zhu\u2019s base salary decreased in 2024 as compared to 2023 due to certain geographic considerations that arose in 2023 when he was on assignment from Gigafactory Shanghai. The following table sets forth information regarding the annualized base salary rates at the end of 2024 for our named executive officers: Ending Fiscal 2024 Name Base Salary($)(1) Elon Musk \u2014 (2) Vaibhav Taneja 400,000 Tom Zhu 350,000 Andrew Baglino \u2014 (3) (1) Reflects an annualized rate assuming 52 weeks each comprised of five work days. Mr. Taneja\u2019s base salary was adjusted in October 2024. (2) Mr. Musk historically earned a base salary that reflected the applicable minimum wage requirements under California law, and he was subject to income taxes based on such base salary. However, he has never accepted his salary. Commencing in May 2019 at Mr. Musk\u2019s request, we eliminated altogether the earning and accrual of this base salary. (3) Mr. Baglino departed Tesla in April 2024. His annualized base salary rate at his time of departure was $300,000. Equity-Based Incentives Our equity award program is the primary vehicle for offering long-term incentives to our named executive officers. The equity awards we have historically granted and currently grant are options to purchase shares of our common stock and restricted stock unit awards that are settled in shares of our common stock upon vesting. We have granted to our named executive officers both awards that vest over a long-term period and awards that vest only upon the achievement of specified Tesla performance milestones, in each case subject to continued service. We emphasize the grant of stock option awards for our named executive officers, which have value only to the extent, if any, that our stock price increases following their grant. Accordingly, since 2020, equity awards granted to our named executive officers have primarily been in the form of stock options: Mr. Zhu, our Senior Vice President, APAC, received 100% of his equity award as stock options upon his promotion to such role in 2023, and Mr. Taneja, our Chief Financial Officer, received approximately 80% of his equity award as stock options in 2024, following the 2024 review of our compensation programs discussed in \u201cCompensation Philosophy \u201d above and in consideration of his promotion in August 2023 to the role of Chief Financial Officer. As a result, a significant portion of our named executive officers\u2019 total compensation is entirely at risk, depending on long-term stock price performance. 8 While we strive to offer a total level of compensation that is competitive within specific roles and geographical markets, we do not have a rigid set of criteria for granting equity awards; instead, the Compensation Committee exercises its judgment and discretion, in consultation with our Chief Executive Officer and from time to time, a compensation consultant (other than with respect to decisions pertaining to the Chief Executive Officer\u2019s compensation). To determine the form and amount of equity awards previously granted to named executive officers, the Compensation Committee considers, among other things, the role and responsibility of the named executive officer, competitive market factors, equity awards previously granted to the named executive officer, the impact of any dramatic changes in our stock price over a short period of time and the cash-based compensation received by the named executive officer. We generally grant one-time new hire equity awards to our employees, including executives, upon their commencement of employment with us, or upon their promotion to a new position. Additionally, as part of our ongoing executive compensation review and alignment process, we have periodically granted additional equity awards to our executives. The Compensation Committee granted an equity award to Mr. Taneja in October 2024, following the 2024 review of our compensation programs discussed in \u201c Compensation Philosophy \u201d above and considering his promotion in August 2023 to the role of Chief Financial Officer. Approximately 80% of Mr. Taneja\u2019s equity award was granted as stock options and 20% of the award was granted as restricted stock units. See \u201c Grants of Plan-Based Awards in 2024 \u201d and \u201c Executive Compensation\u2014 Outstanding Equity Awards at 2024 Fiscal Year-End \u201d under this"

The Compensation Committee did not grant any equity awards in 2024 to our other named executive officers, including our Chief Executive Officer. The Compensation Committee meets periodically, including to approve equity award grants to our executives from time to time. We do not have, nor do we plan to establish, any program, plan or practice to time equity award grants in coordination with releasing material non-public information, and the Compensation Committee does not take material non-public information into account when determining the timing and terms of equity awards. Tesla has not timed the disclosure of material non-public information to affect the value of executive compensation. During 2024, there were no stock options granted to any named executive officer within four business days preceding, or within one business day after, the filing of any report on Forms 10-K, 10-Q or 8-K that discloses material non-public information. Severance and Change in Control Benefits No named executive officer has a severance or change in control arrangement with Tesla. Bonus We do not currently have or have planned, and historically we have rarely entered into, any specific arrangements with our named executive officers providing for cash-based bonus awards. Non-Equity Incentive Plan Compensation We did not provide any non-equity incentive plan compensation to any of our named executive officers in 2024, and we do not currently have or have planned any specific arrangements with our named executive officers providing for non-equity incentive plan compensation. Perquisites Generally, we do not provide any perquisites or other personal benefits to our named executive officers which are not offered on a non-discriminatory basis to all employees as well. Health and Welfare Benefits We provide the following benefits to our named executive officers on the same basis provided to all of our employees: \u00b7 medical insurance including comprehensive transgender and fertility coverage, mental health, dental and vision; \u00b7 adoption and surrogacy benefits; 9 \u00b7 confidential Employee Assistance Program counseling; \u00b7 life insurance and accidental death and dismemberment insurance; \u00b7 a Section 401(k) plan where Tesla will provide a company match equal to 50% of the employee\u2019s contribution, up to a maximum of 3% of the employee\u2019s eligible compensation with a $3,000 annual cap; \u00b7 an employee stock purchase plan; \u00b7 short-and long-term disability insurance; \u00b7 medical and dependent care flexible spending account; and \u00b7 a health savings account. Chief Executive Officer Compensation Overview Historically, in developing compensation recommendations for our Chief Executive Officer, the Compensation Committee has sought both to appropriately reward our Chief Executive Officer\u2019s previous and current contributions and to create incentives for our Chief Executive Officer to continue to contribute significantly to successful results in the future. Each of the 2018 CEO Performance Award and the performance-based stock option award granted to our Chief Executive Officer in August 2012 (the \u201c2012 CEO Performance Award\u201d) was focused on this latter objective, as it solely rewards future performance. In addition to serving as our Chief Executive Officer since October 2008, Elon Musk has contributed significantly and actively to us since our earliest days in April 2004 by recruiting executives and engineers, contributing to vehicle engineering and design, raising capital for us, bringing investors to us and raising our public awareness. Cash Compensation Mr. Musk historically earned a base salary that reflected the applicable minimum wage requirements under California law, and he was subject to income taxes based on such base salary. However, he has never accepted his salary. Commencing in May 2019 at Mr. Musk\u2019s request, we eliminated altogether the earning and accrual of this base salary. Historical Equity Compensation Prior to the stock option awards granted in December 2009, Mr. Musk did not receive any equity compensation for his services for a period of five years. In 2010 and 2011, Mr. Musk did not receive any equity grants, because the Compensation Committee believed his grants made in December 2009 already provided sufficient motivation for Mr. Musk to perform his duties as Chief Executive Officer. In August 2012, to create incentives for continued long-term success from the then-recently launched Model S program as well as from Tesla\u2019s then-planned Model X and Model 3 programs, and to further align executive compensation with increases in shareholder value, the Board granted to Mr. Musk the 2012 CEO Performance Award, comprised of a stock option award to purchase 79,123,515 shares (as adjusted for the 2020 Stock Split and 2022 Stock Split) of Tesla\u2019s common stock, representing 5% of Tesla\u2019s total issued and outstanding shares at the time of grant. The 2012 CEO Performance Award consisted of 10 equal vesting tranches, each requiring that Tesla meet a combination of (i) the achievement of a specified operational milestone relating to development of Model X or Model 3, aggregate vehicle production or a gross margin target, and (ii) a sustained incremental $4 billion increase in Tesla\u2019s market capitalization from $3.2 billion, Tesla\u2019s market capitalization at the time of grant. Prior to its expiration in 2022, the market capitalization conditions for all of the 10 vesting tranches and nine of the 10 operational milestones had been achieved, and nine of 10 tranches under the 2012 CEO Performance Award vested. 10 Prior to 2018, the only additional equity awards received by Mr. Musk related to certain immaterial awards granted during 2013 pursuant to a patent incentive program that was available to our employees generally. 2018 CEO Performance Award Early in 2017, with the 2012 CEO Performance Award heading to substantial completion after having helped Tesla grow its market capitalization to over $55 billion in just over five years, the independent members of the Board began preliminary discussions regarding how to continue to incentivize Mr. Musk to lead Tesla through the next phase of its development. In January 2018, following more than six months of careful analysis and development led by the Compensation Committee, with participation by every independent Board member, the help of Compensia and engagement with and feedback from our largest institutional shareholders, the Board"

In January 2018, following more than six months of careful analysis and development led by the Compensation Committee, with participation by every independent Board member, the help of Compensia and engagement with and feedback from our largest institutional shareholders, the Board granted the 2018 CEO Performance Award to Mr. Musk. Such grant was subject to approval by a majority of the total votes of Tesla common stock not owned by Mr. Musk or Kimbal Musk cast at a meeting of the shareholders to approve the 2018 CEO Performance Award. On March 21, 2018, such approval was obtained, with approximately 73% of the votes cast by such disinterested shares voting in favor of the 2018 CEO Performance Award. The 2018 CEO Performance Award was comprised of a 10-year maximum term stock option to purchase 303,960,630 shares (as adjusted for the 2020 Stock Split and 2022 Stock Split) of Tesla\u2019s common stock, divided equally among 12 separate tranches that were each equivalent to 1% of the issued and outstanding shares of Tesla\u2019s common stock at the time of grant, at an exercise price of $23.34 per share (as adjusted for the 2020 Stock Split and 2022 Stock Split). Each of the 12 tranches of the 2018 CEO Performance Award vested upon certification by the Board that both (i) the market capitalization milestone for such tranche, which began at $100 billion for the first tranche and increased by increments of $50 billion thereafter and (ii) any one of the following eight operational milestones focused on revenue or eight operational milestones focused on profitability, was met: Total Revenue* Adjusted EBITDA** (in billions) (in billions) $20.0 $1.5 $35.0 $3.0 $55.0 $4.5 $75.0 $6.0 $100.0 $8.0 $125.0 $10.0 $150.0 $12.0 $175.0 $14.0 * \u201cRevenue\u201d means total revenues as reported in Tesla\u2019s financial statements on Forms 10-Q or 10-K filed with the SEC for the previous four consecutive fiscal quarters. ** \u201cAdjusted EBITDA\u201d means (i) net income (loss) attributable to common shareholders before (ii) interest expense, (iii) (benefit) provision for income taxes, (iv) depreciation and amortization, and (v) stock-based compensation, as each such"

Any single operational milestone could only satisfy the vesting requirement of one tranche, together with the corresponding market capitalization milestone. Subject to any applicable clawback provisions, policies or other forfeiture terms, once a milestone was achieved, it was forever deemed achieved for purposes of determining the vesting of a tranche. Meeting more than 12 of the 16 operational milestones does not result in any additional vesting or other compensation to Mr. Musk under the 2018 CEO Performance Award. Except in a change in control situation, measurement of the market capitalization milestones was based on both (i) a six calendar month trailing average of Tesla\u2019s stock price as well as (ii) a 30 calendar day trailing average of Tesla\u2019s stock price, in each case based on trading days only. Upon the consummation of certain acquisitions or split-up, spin-off or divestiture transactions, each then-unachieved market capitalization milestone and/or operational milestone would have been adjusted to offset the impact of such transactions to the extent they had been considered material to the achievement of those milestones. In establishing the Revenue and Adjusted EBITDA milestones, the Board carefully considered a variety of factors, including Tesla\u2019s growth trajectory and internal growth plans and the historical performance of other high-growth and high-multiples companies in the technology space that have invested in new businesses and tangible assets. These benchmarks provided revenue/EBITDA to market capitalization multiples, which were then used to inform the specific operational targets that aligned with Tesla\u2019s plans for future growth. Nevertheless, the Board considered each of the market capitalization and operational milestones to be challenging hurdles. For example, in order to meet all 12 market capitalization milestones, Tesla was required to add approximately $600 billion to its market capitalization at the time of the grant of the 2018 CEO Performance Award on a sustained basis, and in order to satisfy all eight revenue-based operational milestones, Tesla would have to increase revenue by more than $163 billion from its annual revenue of approximately $11.8 billion in 2017, the last fiscal year completed prior to the grant of the 2018 CEO Performance Award. 11 In addition, Mr. Musk was required to continue leading Tesla as our Chief Executive Officer or, alternatively, as our Chief Product Officer and Executive Chairman (with any other Chief Executive Officer reporting directly to him), at the time each milestone is met in order for the corresponding tranche to vest. With limited exceptions, Mr. Musk must hold any shares that he acquires upon exercise of the 2018 CEO Performance Award for at least five years post-exercise. There would have been no acceleration of vesting of the 2018 CEO Performance award upon Mr. Musk\u2019s termination, death or disability or a change in control of Tesla. However, in a change in control situation, the achievement of the milestones would have been based solely on the market capitalization milestones, with the measurement of Tesla\u2019s market capitalization determined by the product of the total number of outstanding shares of Tesla common stock immediately before the change in control multiplied by the greater of the last closing price of a share of Tesla common stock before the effective time of the change in control or the per share price (plus the per share value of any other consideration) received by Tesla\u2019s shareholders in the change in control. In the event of a restatement of Tesla\u2019s financial statements previously filed with the SEC, if a lesser portion of the 2018 CEO Performance Award would have vested based on the restated financial results, then Tesla will require forfeiture (or repayment, as applicable) of the portion of the 2018 CEO Performance Award that would not have vested based on the restated financial results (less any amounts Mr. Musk may have paid to Tesla in exercising any forfeited awards). The 2018 CEO Performance Award is subject, if more stringent than the foregoing, to any current or future Tesla clawback policy applicable to equity awards, provided that the policy does not discriminate solely against Mr. Musk except as required by applicable law. As of the date of this filing, all of the milestones have been achieved and certified by our Board. Consequently, all 12 of the 12 tranches under the 2018 CEO Performance Award, corresponding to options to purchase an aggregate 303,960,630 shares of Tesla\u2019s common stock, have vested and become exercisable, subject to Mr. Musk\u2019s payment of the exercise price of $23.34 per share and the minimum five-year holding period generally applicable to any shares he acquires upon exercise.

Such amount is required to be reported even if Mr. Musk does not actually receive any cash from such exercise or vesting, either because he does not also sell any shares or because he sells only a number of shares sufficient to cover the related tax liabilities resulting from the exercise or vesting. As a result, there may be a significant disconnect between what is reported as compensation for Mr. Musk in a given year in such sections and the value actually realized as compensation in that year or over a period of time. Moreover, the vast majority of compensation in respect of past stock option grants to Mr. Musk, including the 2012 CEO Performance Award and the 2018 CEO Performance Award, were structured to be incentives for future performance with their value realizable only if Tesla\u2019s stock price appreciated compared to the dates of the grants, and if the Company achieved applicable vesting requirements. 12 To supplement the disclosures in \u201c Summary Compensation Table, \u201d \u201c Pay Ratio Disclosure \u201d and \u201c 2024 Option Exercises and Stock Vested \u201d under this"

We have not provided or committed to provide any executive officer or director with a gross-up or other reimbursement for tax amounts the executive might pay pursuant to Section 280G or Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code (the \u201cTax Code\u201d). Section 280G and related Tax Code sections provide that executive officers, directors who hold significant shareholder interests and certain other service providers could be subject to significant additional excise taxes if they receive payments or benefits in connection with a change in control of Tesla that exceeds certain limits, and that we or our successor could lose a deduction on the amounts subject to the additional tax. Section 409A also imposes additional significant taxes on the individual in the event that an executive officer, director or service provider of certain types receives \u201cdeferred compensation\u201d that does not meet the requirements of Section 409A. Tax Deduction Limit . Section 162(m) of the Tax Code generally disallows a tax deduction to public corporations for compensation greater than $1,000,000 paid in any fiscal year to certain executive officers. The Compensation Committee has not adopted a formal policy regarding tax deductibility of compensation paid to our executive officers and reserves the right to pay compensation that may not be deductible to Tesla if it determines that doing so would be in the best interests of Tesla. 13 Accounting Implications . We follow ASC Topic 718 for our stock-based compensation awards. ASC Topic 718 requires companies to measure the compensation expense for all stock-based compensation awards made to employees and directors based on the grant date \u201cfair value\u201d of these awards. This calculation is performed for accounting purposes and reported in the compensation tables below, even though our named executive officers may never realize any value from their awards. ASC Topic 718 also requires companies to recognize the compensation cost of their stock-based compensation awards in their income statements over the period that an executive officer is required to render service in exchange for the option or other award. Other Information On June 4, 2018, a Tesla shareholder filed a shareholder derivative complaint in the Delaware Court of Chancery against Mr. Musk and certain current and former Tesla directors in connection with the Tesla Board\u2019s approval of the 2018 CEO Performance Award. On January 30, 2024, the Court issued a post-trial opinion that granted the plaintiff\u2019s request that the 2018 CEO Performance Award be fully rescinded. In addition, following the recommendation of a special committee of the Board, the Board (with Mr. Musk and Kimbal Musk recusing themselves) determined that the ratification of the 2018 CEO Performance Award was in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders, approved the ratification (the \u201cRatification\u201d) of the 2018 Performance Award, directed that the Ratification be submitted to the shareholders at the 2024 annual meeting, and recommended that shareholders approve the Ratification. The Ratification was approved by the shareholders at the 2024 annual meeting. Following the Ratification, Tesla requested that the Delaware Court revise its decision to rescind the 2018 CEO Performance Award. On December 2, 2024, the Delaware Court rejected the request to revise its decision. On December 13, 2024, the Delaware Court entered a final judgment rescinding the 2018 CEO Performance Award. Tesla is appealing the Delaware Court\u2019s decision to not recognize the Ratification, its decision to reject the request to revise its decision, and its judgment rescinding the 2018 CEO Performance Award. The current and former Tesla directors are also appealing the Delaware Court\u2019s post-trial decision.

(3) Includes Mr. Baglino\u2019s exercise, in connection with his departure from Tesla in April 2024, of all of his remaining vested options within the period required by the terms and conditions of the applicable award for post-termination exercise. Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change in Control We do not have an employment agreement for any specific term with any of our named executive officers. Moreover, we do not have any contract, agreement, plan or arrangement that would result in payments to a named executive officer at, following, or in connection with any termination of employment, including resignation, severance, retirement or a constructive termination of employment of a named executive officer, or a change in control of Tesla or a change in the named executive officer\u2019s responsibilities. Pay Ratio Disclosure Tesla is committed to fair and competitive compensation for our employees. Moreover, Elon Musk, the Technoking of Tesla and our Chief Executive Officer, has agreed to a compensation arrangement in the 2018 CEO Performance Award that is substantially tied to the appreciation of our market capitalization. Because equity awards are generally made available to Tesla employees, this also means that Mr. Musk\u2019s compensation is tied to the success of Tesla employees. We are providing a ratio of (i) Mr. Musk\u2019s 2024 annual total compensation to (ii) the median of the 2024 annual total compensation of all applicable qualifying Tesla employees other than Mr. Musk, in each case calculated pursuant to the disclosure requirements of \u201c Summary Compensation Table \u201d above. As we continue our expansion, the median annual total compensation of our employees reflects differences in local compensation scales and practices. 17 Mr. Musk\u2019s 2024 annual total compensation, as reported under \u201c Summary Compensation Table ,\u201d was $0, and the median 2024 annual total compensation of all other qualifying employees, as determined pursuant to the methodology set forth below, was $57,243. Consequently, the applicable ratio of such amounts for 2024 was 0.00:1. Our methodology for identifying the median of the 2024 annual total compensation for each individual other than Mr. Musk was as follows: \u00b7 We selected December 31, 2024, which is within the last three months of 2024, as the date upon which we would identify the \u201cmedian employee\u201d because it enabled us to make such identification in a reasonably efficient and economical manner. \u00b7 We determined that as of December 31, 2024, Tesla and all our subsidiaries had 126,507 individuals qualifying for this analysis (full-time, part-time and temporary employees other than Mr. Musk, subject to the following bullet), of which approximately 43% were based outside of the U.S. and approximately 37% were production line employees. \u00b7 We did not"

Employee Risks The Compensation Committee oversees management of risks relating to Tesla\u2019s compensation plans and programs. Tesla\u2019s management and the Compensation Committee have assessed the risks associated with Tesla\u2019s compensation policies and practices for all employees, including non-executive officers. These include risks relating to setting ambitious targets for our employees\u2019 compensation or the vesting of their equity awards and our emphasis on at-risk equity-based compensation, and the potential impact of such practices on the retention or decision-making of our employees, particularly our senior management. Based on the results of this assessment, Tesla does not believe that its compensation policies and practices for all employees, including non-executive officers, create risks that are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on Tesla. Compensation of Directors 2024 Director Compensation Table The following table provides information concerning the compensation paid by us to each of our non-employee directors who served during any part of fiscal year 2024. Elon Musk, who is a named executive officer, does not receive additional compensation for his services as a director. 18 The awards with respect to which values are provided under the column \u201cOption Awards\u201d below are exclusively stock options, which have realizable value only if they vest over time and to the extent, if any, that our stock price exceeds the applicable exercise prices. The values provided below for these awards are based on applicable accounting standards, and do not necessarily reflect the actual amounts realized or realizable pursuant to the underlying stock options.

The earning and payment of cash retainer payments payable to outside directors may be waived in whole or part at the election of the director. All seven of the outside directors have requested that the Company eliminate the future payment of all of their cash retainer amounts for service on the Board unless the director notified otherwise.

See \u201cOther Information\u201d below for additional information regarding the Detroit Settlement Agreement. (4) In connection with the Detroit Settlement Agreement, certain current or former directors have agreed to, among other things, return to Tesla certain unexercised options, totaling 1,957,861, that were awarded as compensation from 2017 to 2020 (the \u201cReturned Options\u201d). Tesla expects to implement the provisions of the Detroit Settlement Agreement in May 2025 by cancelling the Returned Options. Once the Returned Options are cancelled, the number of authorized shares under the Tesla, Inc. 2019 Equity Incentive Plan will be increased by the number of Returned Options. The Returned Options are included in this table. 19 Overview and Philosophy The compensation program for Tesla\u2019s non-employee directors is designed to be consistent with our compensation philosophy for our employees, with an emphasis on equity-based compensation over cash in order to align the value of their compensation with the market value of our stock, and consequently, with the long-term interests of our shareholders. Moreover, while we offer to our general employee population restricted stock units that will retain some value even if the market value of our stock decreases, the equity-based compensation to our directors has been exclusively in the form of stock options, which have zero initial value and accumulate value, if at all, only to the extent that our stock price increases following their grant, through the applicable vesting dates and until such stock options are ultimately exercised and the underlying shares are sold. The remaining portion of our directors\u2019 compensation has consisted of cash retainer payments that are relatively modest compared to peer companies and that may be waived at the election of each director. Consequently, a large portion and in some cases, the entirety, of each of our non-employee directors\u2019 compensation is entirely at risk, and fluctuating stock prices have at times resulted in 100% of the vested stock options then held by each of our non-employee directors being out-of-the-money. In 2020 and 2021, the Compensation Committee reviewed the Director Compensation Policy with the aid of Compensia and in light of Tesla\u2019s exceptional performance and commitment to at-risk director compensation in the form of annual stock option awards to ensure continued alignment of the interests of directors with those of Tesla\u2019s shareholders. Following such review, the Compensation Committee recommended that the Board approve a resolution that all existing directors forego any automatic grants of annual stock option awards under the Director Compensation Policy or otherwise previously approved by the Board until July 2022 unless the Board earlier acts to amend the Director Compensation Policy or otherwise amends such resolution. In June 2021, the Board unanimously approved and adopted this resolution and in May 2022, the Board agreed to further forego the Board Stock Option Grants until the Board earlier acts to amend the Director Compensation Policy or otherwise amends such resolution. The Compensation Committee intends to make further recommendations with respect to the Board\u2019s compensation program for directors, if any, who join the Board after the date of this resolution, as well as for future periods of service by existing directors, following further periodic reviews. Other Information If, following a change in control of Tesla, the service of a non-employee director is terminated, all stock options granted to the director shall fully vest and become immediately exercisable. Non-employee directors may also have their travel, lodging and related expenses associated with attending Board or Board committee meetings reimbursed by Tesla. On June 17, 2020, a purported Tesla stockholder filed a derivative action in the Delaware Court of Chancery, purportedly on behalf of Tesla, against certain of Tesla\u2019s current and former directors regarding compensation awards granted to Tesla\u2019s directors, other than Elon Musk, between 2017 and 2020. The suit asserts claims for breach of fiduciary duty and unjust enrichment and seeks declaratory and injunctive relief, unspecified damages and other relief. Defendants filed their answer on September 17, 2020. On July 14, 2023, the parties filed a Stipulation and Agreement of Compromise and Settlement, which does not involve an admission of any wrongdoing by any party. Pursuant to the terms of the agreement, Tesla provided notice of the proposed settlement to stockholders of record as of July 14, 2023. The Court held a hearing regarding the settlement on October 13, 2023, after which it took the settlement and plaintiff counsels\u2019 fee request under advisement. On January 8, 2025, the Court approved the settlement and awarded Plaintiff\u2019s counsel fees in the amount of approximately $176 million. A final judgment was entered by the Court on January 13, 2025. The Company disagrees with the amount of attorneys\u2019 fees awarded by the court. On February 10, 2025, Tesla appealed the attorneys\u2019 fee award amount to the Delaware Supreme Court. Tesla did not appeal the Delaware Court of Chancery\u2019s approval of the underlying settlement. Also on February 10, 2025, a single shareholder appealed the approval of the settlement. This shareholder\u2019s appeal does not seek to alter any material terms (e.g., financial"

This shareholder\u2019s appeal does not seek to alter any material terms (e.g., financial contributions or the defendants\u2019 obligations under the Detroit Settlement Agreement). The Delaware Court of Chancery had previously rejected this shareholder\u2019s objections when approving the Detroit Settlement Agreement. Because neither Tesla\u2019s appeal nor the shareholder\u2019s appeal seeks to vacate the Detroit Settlement Agreement or materially modify its terms, the Company expects to implement the provisions of the Detroit Settlement Agreement in May 2025 by cancelling the options requiring cancellation under its terms. The settlement is not expected to have an adverse impact on our results of operations, cash flows or financial position. Pledging of Shares The ability of our directors and executive officers to pledge Tesla stock for personal loans and investments is inherently related to their compensation due to our use of equity awards and promotion of long-termism and an ownership culture. Moreover, providing these individuals flexibility in financial planning without having to rely on the sale of shares aligns their interests with those of our shareholders. In order to mitigate the risk of forced sales of pledged shares, the Board has a policy that limits pledging of Tesla stock by our directors and executive officers. Pursuant to this policy, directors and executive officers may pledge their stock (exclusive of options, warrants, restricted stock units or other rights to purchase stock) as collateral for loans and investments, provided that the maximum aggregate loan or investment amount collateralized by such pledged stock does not exceed, (i) with respect to our CEO, the lesser of $3.5 billion or twenty-five percent (25%) of the total value of the pledged stock, or (ii) with respect to our directors and officers other than our CEO, fifteen percent (15%) of the total value of the pledged stock. 20 Example: A director (other than our CEO) pledges 1,000 shares as collateral for a loan, and the current stock price is $800 per share. The director may borrow up to 15% of 1,000 x $800, or $120,000, against such shares. If the stock price later increases to $1,600 per share, the director may borrow up to an additional $120,000 against the pledged shares. If the director borrows the full allowable amount of $240,000 and the stock price then decreases to $1,200, the director must repay $60,000 to maintain compliance with the 15% limit under the pledging policy.

As of December 31, 2024, based on written representations of our directors and executive officers to the Company, the aggregate loan or investment amount collateralized by our directors and executive officers\u2019 pledged shares was less than 1% of the total value of the pledged shares. We require our directors and executive officers to make written representations, at least annually, that he or she is in compliance with our pledging policy. If a director or executive officer wishes to take a loan collateralized by pledged stock, Tesla management works with the director or executive officer during the original loan approval, and subsequently monitors compliance with this policy by regularly reviewing and requesting updates from the applicable director or executive officer on his or her pledged stock amount and loan amount. If necessary, Tesla management will report to the Board or its committees the extent to which any officer or director has pledged shares of Company stock.

      "text": "of Regulation S-K. Under the RPT Policy, the Audit Committee must review and approve all transactions in which (i) Tesla or one of its subsidiaries is a participant, (ii) the amount involved exceeds $120,000 and (iii) a related person has a direct or indirect material interest, other than transactions available to all Tesla employees generally. In assessing a related person transaction brought before it for approval the Audit Committee considers, among other factors, whether the related person transaction is on terms no less favorable than terms generally available to an unaffiliated third-party under the same or similar circumstances and the extent of the related person\u2019s interest in the transaction. The Audit Committee may then approve or disapprove the transaction in its discretion, or may request additional information. Related person transactions will be disclosed in the applicable SEC filing as required by the rules of the SEC. Related Person Transactions Elon Musk is an executive officer, director and/or significant shareholder of SpaceX, X, xAI and TBC. In March 2025, xAI and X effected a transaction under which xAI and X became wholly-owned subsidiaries of a new parent company named X.AI Holdings Corp. SpaceX is party to certain commercial, licensing and support agreements with Tesla. Under these agreements, SpaceX incurred expenses of approximately $2.4 million in 2024 and approximately $0.1 million through February 2025. Since April 2016, SpaceX has invoiced Tesla for our use of an aircraft owned and operated by SpaceX at rates determined by Tesla and SpaceX, subject to rules of the Federal Aviation Administration governing such arrangements. Tesla incurred expenses of approximately $0.8 million in 2024 and approximately $0.04 million through February 2025. X is party to certain commercial, consulting and support agreements with Tesla. Under these agreements, Tesla incurred expenses of approximately $0.1 million in 2024. As part of a multi-platform advertising campaign, Tesla also directly or indirectly purchased advertising on X, which totaled approximately $0.4 million in 2024 and approximately $0.01 million through February 2025. xAI is party to certain commercial (including those for the purchase of Megapacks), consulting and support agreements with Tesla. Under these agreements, xAI incurred expenses of approximately $198.3 million in 2024 and approximately $36.9 million through February 2025. Approximately $191.0 million during 2024 and $36.8 million through February 2025 was incurred by xAI for its purchase of our Megapack products. TBC is party to commercial agreements with Tesla. Under these agreements, Tesla incurred expenses of approximately $3.6 million in 2024 and approximately $0.8 million through February 2025. We are party to a service agreement with a security company, owned by Elon Musk and organized to provide security services concerning him, including in connection with his duties to and work for Tesla. Tesla incurred expenses of approximately $2.8 million for such security services in 2024 and approximately $0.5 million through February 2025, representing a portion of the total cost of security services concerning Elon Musk. JB Straubel is the Chief Executive Officer of Redwood. Tesla is party to an agreement with Redwood to supply certain scrap materials. Under this agreement, Redwood incurred expenses of approximately $30.3 million in 2024 and approximately $0.6 million through February 2025. Kimbal Musk is the Chief Executive Officer of Nova Sky Stories. In 2024, we entered into a commercial agreement with Nova Sky Stories in relation to the production of an aerial show. Under this agreement, Tesla incurred expenses of approximately $0.3 million in 2024. Other Transactions Tesla periodically does business with certain entities its directors are affiliated with. Such transactions are done on terms no less favorable than terms generally available to an unaffiliated third-party under the same or similar circumstances. 24 In the ordinary course of business, we enter into offer letters with our executive officers. We have also entered into indemnification agreements with each of our directors and officers. The indemnification agreements and our certificate of formation and bylaws require us to indemnify our directors and officers to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law. In relation to our CEO\u2019s exercise of stock options and sale of common stock from the 2012 CEO Performance Award, Tesla withheld the appropriate amount of taxes. However, given the significant amounts involved, our CEO entered into an indemnification agreement with us in November 2021 to indemnify the Company for additional taxes owed, if any. Director Independence The Board periodically assesses, with the recommendation of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee, the independence of its members as defined in the listing standards of Nasdaq and applicable law. The Board undertook an analysis for each director and director nominee and considered all relevant facts and circumstances, including the director\u2019s other commercial, accounting, legal, banking, consulting, charitable and familial relationships. The Board determined that with respect to each of its current members and director nominees, other than Elon Musk, who is our Chief Executive Officer, and Kimbal Musk, who is Elon Musk\u2019s brother, there are no disqualifying factors with respect to director independence enumerated in the listing standards of Nasdaq or any relationships that would interfere with the exercise of independent judgment in carrying out the responsibilities of a director, and that each such member is an \u201cindependent director\u201d as defined in the listing standards of Nasdaq and applicable laws. In particular, the Board reviewed the following considerations: \u00b7 Ira Ehrenpreis, Joe Gebbia, James Murdoch, Elon Musk, Kimbal Musk and JB Straubel and/or investment funds affiliated with them, have made minority investments in certain companies or investment funds (i) of which other Tesla directors are founders, significant shareholders, directors, officers, or managers, and/or (ii) with which Tesla has had certain relationships, such as those set forth in \u201c Related Person Transactions \u201d under this"
